h1. Sublime Text 2 HTML preprocessor plugin

This is a plugin for web devs :

* who has to deal with a lot of HTML files
* who wants something similar to HAML *without* Ruby

h2. What it does

The plugin will create a new HTML/XML file in the same directory as your *.shpaml* file once you save it.

h2. SHPAML ?

bq. SHPAML allows you to produce HTML with cleaner syntax, without introducing any other layer of abstraction.
